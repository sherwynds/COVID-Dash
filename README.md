# COVID-Dash
ðŸ“‰ Interactive Flask/Bokeh dashboard for COVID-19 data in Canada: [covid-can-dash.herokuapp.com](http://covid-can-dash.herokuapp.com/)

**Note:** The website might take long to load on Heroku because it puts the web app to sleep when not in use. It will load much faster locally. It is also a WIP that needs to be updated following changes to its dependencies, so graphs might not display correctly right now.

Our lives have been structurally and materially altered by the global pandemic in a multitude of ways. Interested in analyzing the growth rate of the novel coronavirus, I built a web app to calculate and track the increase in total coronavirus cases by province in Canada. It pulls JSON data from [api.covid19api.com](https://api.covid19api.com/).

Check out the link to the live web app, or clone this repository, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` and then `flask run`.

Special thanks to Michelle Illing for curating the color palette.
