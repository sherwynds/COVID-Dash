# COVID-Dash
📉 A Flask/Bokeh dashboard for COVID-19 data in Canada - [http://covid-can-dash.herokuapp.com/](http://covid-can-dash.herokuapp.com/)

Our lives have been structurally and materially altered by the global pandemic in one way or another. Interested in analyzing the growth rate of the novel coronavirus, I built a web app to calculate and track the increase in total coronavirus cases by province in Canada. It pulls JSON data from [https://api.covid19api.com/](https://api.covid19api.com/).

Check out the link to the live web app, or clone this repository, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` and then `flask run`.

Special thanks to Michell Illing for curating the color palette.
